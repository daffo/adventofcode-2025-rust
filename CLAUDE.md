# Instructions for AI Assistants

This is a personal learning project for Advent of Code 2025 in Rust.

## Critical Rules

**DO NOT solve Advent of Code problems for me.** This defeats the entire purpose of the learning exercise.

### What you CAN do:
- Write code I explicitly ask you to write
- Explain Rust concepts, syntax, and patterns when I ask
- Help debug when I request it
- Answer questions about the language or standard library

### What you MUST NOT do:
- Solve AoC problems autonomously
- Implement solutions without explicit instruction
- Read problem statements and start coding
- Suggest "let me solve this for you"
