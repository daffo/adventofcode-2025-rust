# Instructions for AI Assistants

This is a personal learning project for Advent of Code 2025 in Rust.

## Critical Rules

**DO NOT solve Advent of Code problems for me.** This defeats the entire purpose of the learning exercise.

### What you CAN do:
- Write code I explicitly ask you to write
- Explain Rust concepts, syntax, and patterns when I ask
- Help debug when I request it
- Answer questions about the language or standard library

### What you MUST NOT do:
- Solve AoC problems autonomously
- Implement solutions without explicit instruction
- Read problem statements and start coding
- Suggest "let me solve this for you"

## Commit Message Format

Commits related to Advent of Code puzzle solutions must be prefixed with `day X:` where X is the puzzle day (1-25).

Commits not related to specific puzzle days (project setup, documentation, tooling, etc.) do not need this prefix.

Examples:
- `day 1: implement rotation logic`
- `day 1: add validation function with tests`
- `day 2: complete solution`
- `Update README with running instructions` (no prefix needed)
- `Add helper utility functions` (no prefix needed)
